    `Hello there! I'm David. I am passionate about software development with a focus on full-stack development. I have 2+ years of full-time, co-op, and self-employment work experience as a software engineer developing on the entire stack. That includes component-based front-end development in React, RESTful API back-end development in Express & Flask, and database management in SQL with RDBMS such as PostgreSQL and MySQL. Most of my experience is in the JavaScript ecosystem, but I have experiences in other languages such as Python, C#, and Java.`,
    `I graduated from the University of Alberta June 2021 with a bachelors in computer engineering. The courses I took served a strong foundation for my knowledge in software engineering. That includes data structures and algorithms, object-oriented design, operating systems, database management systems, computer architecture, computer networking, and parallel and distributed systems.`,
    `I am early on in my career; I am looking to grow professionally as a software engineer and as a team player. I am open to learning and exposing myself to new ideas and methodologies. I take on challenges with a can-do attitude and an eagerness to dive into complex problems. I am always looking to improve myself and find better ways to do things.`,
    `Outside of software, I'm an outdoorsy person. In my free time, I like to go walking, running, swimming, biking, hiking, and snowboarding.`,
